# line-follower-with-servo-control
usually a line follower changes its direction by its differential wheels
which is done by stopping one side of wheel and rotating other side wheel. 
But in this project a servomotor is used instead of a differential motor system
which is fixed at front side of the chasis to changes its direction

omponents used are 
1.l298n
2.arduino
3.chasis
4.dc motor
5.ir sensor or ldr
6.jumper cable
