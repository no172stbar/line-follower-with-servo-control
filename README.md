# line-follower-with-servo-control
usually a line follower changes its direction by its differential wheels
which is done by stopping one side of wheel and rotating other side wheel 
But in this project a servomotor is used instead of a differential motor system
which is fixed at front side of the chasis and looks like a trciyle
